****## Project Overview**

   Welcome to the Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis project repository! This project features a detailed analysis of coffee shop sales using advanced Excel techniques.
   The analysis offers insights into Total Sales by Store Location, Top Selling Products, and other valuable business metrics.

****##Key Objectives**

Product Data Extraction 
   Our analysis involved extracting crucial product details:
   - Size: Extracted product sizes using power query editor.
   - Product Price: Obtained product prices.
   - Total Sales: Obtained Total Sales by Week and Month.

**##Business Insights**

This project leverages advanced Excel techniques to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a coffee shop chain's sales performance. The key insights derived from the analysis include:

1. Total Sales by Month: The data reveals monthly sales trends, with June having the highest revenue of $196.73K, followed by May at $168.49K.
2. Top 5 Selling Products: The analysis highlights the top-selling products, led by Barista Espresso, followed by Brewed Black tea, Gourmet brewed coffee, Brewed Chai tea, and Hot chocolate.
3. Sales by Day of the Week: Saturday generates the highest sales of $86.13K, while Sunday has the lowest sales of $66.95K, indicating weekly sales patterns.
4. Quantity Sold by Hour: The chart shows hourly sales patterns, with peaks during morning and afternoon hours, aligning with typical coffee shop traffic.
5. Total Sales by Store and Month: The data compares sales across three store locations (Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan) over the months
   of March, April, May, and June, enabling location-specific performance analysis.

This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and location performance, enabling data-driven decision-making
for the coffee shop chain's operations, product offerings, and marketing strategies

# **Project Conclusion**

our analysis has revealed several important sales patterns. Firstly, the most prominent peak-sales months are May and June, often centered around Saturdays. 
Further, the Barista Espresso and Brewed Black Tea are our most popular products, alongside Gourmet Brewed Coffee. We have also determined that there are spikes
in customer traffic each hour and degrade in performance from one location to another. These findings suggest opportunities to improve staff and inventory capacity
during the peak, concentrate advertisement of the store’s best-selling products, and orchestrate sales strategies according to the store’s need. This three-pronged 
approach will increase productivity, ensure customer satisfaction, and foster the business’s growth
